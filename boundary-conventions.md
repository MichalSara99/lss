## Boundary and initial/terminal conditions conventions

### Boundary Conditions

LSS supports three types of boundary conditions: **Dirichlet**, **Neumann** and **Robin**. All solvers except for specific ones (so far only Heston type) allow any combination of these. 

### ODE Solvers

For ODEs we assume the 

#### Dirichlet Boundary

#### Neumann Boundary

#### Robin Boundary


### 1D PDE Solvers

$$\frac{\partial f(y)}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \times \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$$
